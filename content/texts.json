To make your journey even more challenging, your Moon Buggy comes under missile fire from alien UFOs, some of which create even more craters.", "", "  Push the up arrow to jump over craters, rocks, and other obstacles.

A timer at the bottom of the screen clocks your journey. It starts ticking away the seconds as soon as you start.
